### Week 2: Building with Responsive Design
In this project, the home page of the TNW website (thenextweb.com) is cloned and designed in such a way that it adjusts to various screen sizes. In other words, the page is programmed to alter the way in which elements are displayed according to the size of the screen so that each user may have a smooth experience regardless of their screen size. This is made possible by CSS mediaqueries and techniques such as grid which allow elements to resize and rearrange themselves as the resolution of the screen changes.

## Built With:
